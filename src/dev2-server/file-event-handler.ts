/**
 * FileEventHandler - Handles runtime file system events
 *
 * This class receives file system events (add, change, delete) from the
 * FilesWatcher and processes them in batches for optimal performance.
 *
 * ## Batching Strategy
 *
 * Events are collected and processed after a debounce period (150ms).
 * This batching is crucial when:
 * - Multiple files are created at once (e.g., VSCode extension creating a module)
 * - A file save triggers multiple filesystem events
 * - Large refactoring operations affect many files
 *
 * ## Processing Order
 *
 * 1. **Added files** - Processed first so they're available for imports
 * 2. **Changed files** - Can reference newly added files
 * 3. **Deleted files** - Processed last, dependents are notified
 *
 * ## Batch Add Strategy
 *
 * When multiple files are added (e.g., creating a Warlock module), they're
 * processed using a two-phase approach with topological sorting:
 *
 * 1. **Parse Phase**: All files are parsed to discover dependencies
 * 2. **Sort Phase**: Files are topologically sorted by dependencies
 * 3. **Complete Phase**: Files are finalized in dependency order
 *
 * This ensures that when file A imports file B, file B is processed first.
